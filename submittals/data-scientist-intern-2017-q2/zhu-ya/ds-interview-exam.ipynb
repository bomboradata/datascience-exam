    "A similar problem is power operation. \n",
    "Specifically, an intuitive method that computes $x^n$ by multiplying $x$ for $n$ times would cost time $O(n)$. An optimization is to utilize the following fomula (aka exponentiation by squaring):\n",

    "\n",
    "Thus the problem can be solved in $O(\\log n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is matrix multiplication, which is common in data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "For dense matrices, an iterative method to multiply two $n \\times n$ square matrices can cost $O(n^3)$, while using block partitioning and divide and conquer algorithm, along with some optimizations (e.g., Strassen algorithm) can optimize the problem to $O(n^{\\log7})$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For multiple matrices multiplication (or matrix chain multiplication): $A_1A_2...A_n$, applying dynamic programming method can achieve the optimal order for multiplication with less run time (polynomial) compared to enumerating all position orders (exponential-time).\n",
    "\n",
    "For sparse matrix multiplication, using Compressed Sparse Row(CSR) or Compressed Sparse Column(CSC) which represents a matrix by three one-dimensional arrays can reduce the complexity in both time and memory to $O(\\#nnz)$, where \\#nnz is the number of non-zeros. \n",
    "\n",
    "For matrix multiplication parallelization (which is surly faster than serial methods), optimizations can further improve the computational performance. For instance, when partitioning matrix to blocks in distributed system, optimized scheduling method can save more time by avoiding the situation that processors with sparser blocks (i.e., blocks contain fewer nonzero entries) have to wait for those assigned to denser blocks. In addition, sparse matrix-vector multiplication parallelling method can be optimized by graph partitioning approaches that reorders the entries in the Matrix to reduce the communication between different processors."
