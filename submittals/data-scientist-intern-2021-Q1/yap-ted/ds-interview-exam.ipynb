Since X, Y are random variables, we seek to minimize the expectation of the squared error loss as follows\n",

Given $x$ and some neighbourhood of $k$ points $N_k(x)$, $\\hat{f}(x)$ is simply the average of all $y_i|x_i \\in N_k(x)$.  Let $N$ denote the training sample size. Under mild regularity conditions on the joint probability distribution $Pr(X, Y)$, one can show that as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$, $k \\rightarrow \\infty$ such that $k/N \\rightarrow 0$, then $\\hat{f}(x) \\rightarrow f(x)$ where $\\rightarrow$ means approaches or goes to.

We then perform hyperparameter tunining (with grid search, random search, or bayes optimization) on that model to further lower the generalization error. Ideally, the generalization errors evaluated on train and validation dataset should be low and similar to each other. If the generalization error evaluated on train dataset is high, it means that the model is underfitting and we need to tune our model, train longer, or choose other types of models. If the error on validation dataset is significantly higher than the error on train dataset, it means that the model is overfitting and we should try different methods (more training data, early stopping, regularization, etc.) to prevent overfitting."
