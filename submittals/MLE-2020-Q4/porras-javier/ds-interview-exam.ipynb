The goal is to come up with a function $f(X): \\mathbb{R}^p \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ that minimizes the squared-error loss $(Y - f(X))^2$. Since X, Y are random variables, we seek to minimize the expectation of the squared error loss as follows\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",

For example, linear regression explicitly assumes that the regression function is approximately linear in its arguments, i.e. $\\hat{f}(x) = x^T\\beta$ while a neural network provides a nonlinear approximation of the regression function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest of all these methods is [k-nearest neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm). Given $x$ and some neighbourhood of $k$ points $N_k(x)$, $\\hat{f}(x)$ is simply the average of all $y_i|x_i \\in N_k(x)$.  Let $N$ denote the training sample size. Under mild regularity conditions on the joint probability distribution $Pr(X, Y)$, one can show that as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$, $k \\rightarrow \\infty$ such that $k/N \\rightarrow 0$, then $\\hat{f}(x) \\rightarrow f(x)$ where $\\rightarrow$ means approaches or goes to. In other words, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm converges to the ideal solution as both the training sample size and number of neighbors increase to infinity.\n",

Said in another way, even though KNN is a universal approximator, we can put forth datasets where other methods outperform KNN. Therefore, it is still valuable to research different approximators that might achieve better generalizations in different contexts.\n",

Furthermore, even though it converges to the optimal solution as $N$ and $k$ increases, the complexity of the inference is also linear with respect to $k$. This computational limitations may make KNN undesirable in many practical settings, as compared to parametric models such as neural networks that may scale better in memory with large data and have a relatively low computational tax in inference time."
