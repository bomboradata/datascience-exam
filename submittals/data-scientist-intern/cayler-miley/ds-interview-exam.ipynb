The second implementation using the `for` loop is much better because it doesn't recursively call itself (twice). Instead it will loop for $n-2$ iterations in all cases. There could be optimization of the second function further by finding further patterns to utilize with the fibonacci sequence. Then it would be possible to \"skip\" indices in the second function by computing for example $F_{2n}$ from $F_n$ or $F_{n^2}$ from $F_n$. I don't know if there is a pattern, since I couldn't find one while diagramming it out on a piece of paper, but I am fairly confident there is one. "

A note: there is always a payout of \\\\$1, so the amount paid to the player must be more than \\\\$1.
