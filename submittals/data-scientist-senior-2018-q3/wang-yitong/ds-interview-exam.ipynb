    "The detail of the experiment goes like the following:\n",
    "- Imagine a square area with edge of length 1, and draw a quarter-circle with radius r = 1 (using the any two adjacent edges of the square as the boundary), which yields a shape of area $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$. \n",

The estimate of $\\pi$ will come out to be $4*\\frac{N_{inCircle}}{N_{outCircle}} = 4Q$\n",

    "- The reasoning behind it comes from the geometrical constraint of the pie-shaped area: The distance between any point that falls inside the pie-shaped area and the center of the circle will be less than or equal to the radius of the circle (which is 1 in this case). Putting this into the context of a 2-d coordinate and use (0,0) as the center of the circle. $x$ and $y$ can be considered as the coordinate of any point generated. Hence by using $m \\le 1$ as a constraint can we define whether a point is \"in-circle\" or \"out-circle\"\n",
